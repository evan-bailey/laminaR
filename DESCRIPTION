Author: Evan J. Bailey

Description: A collection of basic data manipulation functions for use with immunofluorescence count data in cortical columns. The functions
    in this package were developed for use in the paper _____, and are included here in this package for replicability, but are not actively maintained.
    This workflow assumes data collected in a specific format across multiple .csv files. These files may be generated by functions within the package, or by accessing
    the data included in the package (see the associated paper for details).
