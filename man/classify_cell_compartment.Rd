)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe.}

\item{distance_col}{The column containing distance values (default: 'Y').}

\item{boundary_cols}{A vector of column names containing boundary distances.}

\item{compartment_mapping}{A named vector mapping compartment names to their corresponding index in boundary_cols.}
}
\value{
A character vector representing the assigned compartment for each cell.
}
\description{
This function categorizes cells into different compartments based on their distance from specified boundaries.
