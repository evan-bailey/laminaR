# laminaR - Data manipulation tools for immunofluorescence data analysis in developmental neuroscience

## Description

This repository contains a draft structure and functions that are useful for the manipulation and analysis of immunofluorescence data in developmental neuroscience. The functions in this repository are largely built around a personal data analysis workflow that  I developed during my PhD project and rely on specific data formatting conventions that are not detailed here.
The motivation for this project was largely to gain experience in R package development tools, and to document my own data manipulation workflow for the specific analyses I performed on column-based cell counts and colabelling data. However, in most cases I have attempted to write the functions in a generic style, and so these may be adaptable to other use cases.

As a very early draft version, the documentation for many of the functions is incomplete. I am unlikely to continue with this project beyond it's current state in the near future, but if you would like to use any of the code or need assistance with understanding the structure of the project or functions, please reach out.
The data that was analysed using these methods is being prepared for publication, and once published, I will include this in the package and include vignettes to demonstrate the functionality.
